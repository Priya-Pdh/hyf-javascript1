Selecting from Many Options with Switch Statements
If you have many options to choose from, use a switch statement. A switch statement tests a value and can have many case statements which define various possible values. Statements are executed from the first matched case value until a break is encountered.

Here is an example of a switch statement:

function caseInSwitch(val) {
  let answer = "";
  // Only change code below this line
  switch(val) {
  case 1:
  answer = "alpha";
  break;
  case 2:
  answer = "beta";
  break;
  case 3:
  answer = "gamma";
  break;
  case 4:
  answer = "delta";
  break;
}

  // Only change code above this line
  return answer;
}

caseInSwitch(1);



// Adding a Default Option in Switch Statements

function switchOfStuff(val) {
  let answer = "";
  // Only change code below this line
 switch(val) {
 case "a":
 answer = "apple";
 break;
 case "b":
 answer = "bird";
 break;
 case "c":
 answer = "cat";
 break;
 default:
 answer = "stuff";
 }
 
  return answer;
 
}

switchOfStuff(1);
