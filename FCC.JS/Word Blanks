Consider this sentence - It was really ____, and we ____ ourselves ____. This sentence has three missing pieces- an adjective, a verb and an adverb, and we can add words of our choice to complete it. We can then assign the completed sentence to a variable as follows:

const sentence = "It was really " + "hot" + ", and we " + "laughed" + " ourselves " + "silly" + ".";


But in variable you donot need to put stings:
NOTE: the variables myNoun, myVerb, myAdjective and myAdverb separated by non-word characters (and any additional words in your madlib).
