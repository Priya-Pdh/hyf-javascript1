//15. Write some code to test two arrays for equality using == and ===. Test the following:

let x = [1, 2, 3];
let y = [1, 2, 3];
let z = y;

//What do you think will happen with x == y, x === y and z == y and z == x? Prove it!

let x = [1, 2, 3];
let y = [1, 2, 3];
let z = y;

console.log(x == y ? "Equal": "Not equal")
// output: "Not equal"

console.log(x === y ? "Equal": "Not equal")
// output: "Not equal"

console.log( "x is not equal to y because both has their own value already been declared which is separetly stored in the memory of the computer, so even though their value is same they are not equal")

console.log(z == y ? "Equal": "Not equal") 
// output: "Equal"
console.log ("z is equal to y becuase the value of z is not determined beforehand so it can take the value of y")

console.log(z == x ? "Equal": "Not equal")
// output: "Not equal"

console.log ("As z has taken the value of y it cannot take the value of x, as z has already stored its value to be as y in the computer's memory")
