// 7. making a list of vehicles creating a variable

const vehiclesList = [
  "motorbike", "caravan", "bike", "bus", "train", "scooter"
]

// 8. to get the 3rd item from the list count its index number and put in console.log

console.log(vehiclesList[2])


// 9. Change the function vehicle to use the list of question 7. So that vehicle("green", 3, 1) prints "a green new bike".

function vehicle(color, age, code){   
  if (age > 3) {
  age ="used";
} else {
  age ="new";
}
  if (code === 1) {
  code = vehiclesList[2];
} else {
  code = "invalid vehicleType"
} 
return ("a " + color + " " + age + " " + code);
  
}
vehicle("green", 3, 1 )

output: 'a green new bike'

//10.
lets create a function called advertisement,

function advertisement() {
  let advertisement = "Amazing Joe's Garage, we service ";
  // using the for loop to create a condition so that the condition that adds the final vechicle in the list with "s. " at the end & "and" before that. also vechicles name are plural i.e add "s" to each of the list.
  // so to do so we can create a statement that when i is at the last array advertisement adds `and ${vehiclesList[i]}s.` else in all other cases it adds `${vehiclesList[i]}s.
  
  for (let i = 0; i < vehiclesList.length; i++) {
    if (i == vehiclesList.length -1) {
     advertisement += `and ${vehiclesList[i]}s.`;}
    else {
     advertisement += `${vehiclesList[i]}s, `;
     }
   }
  return advertisement;
} 
advertisement()

// 11. add one more vehicle to the list and see if it is added to the advertisement or not
vehiclesList.push("ferry")
console.log(vehiclesList)
console.log(advertisement())
